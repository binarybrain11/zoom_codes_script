zoom_codes_script.py

Thanks for using the zoom_codes_script!

To get started, make sure that setup.py, zoom_codes.py, chromedriver.exe, and 
REQUIREMENTS.txt are in the same folder. For organization's sake, I recommend 
they stay in an isolated folder. Also make sure that Chrome is installed. You
can run this with a different browser, details below. This script will produce 
three .txt files: debug.txt, settings.txt, and zoom_codes.txt, and it will 
install the python libraries found in REQUIREMENTS.txt. To get started, just
run zoom_codes.py. The first time will take you through setup, but after the 
first time make sure to take your hands away from the keyboard and mouse while 
the script is running, If you want to add more meetings, just run setup.py 
again. 

Extra details:

setup.py 
This should be called by zoom_codes.py to produce settings.txt and 
zoom_codes.txt. When run for a second or more times, this script will create a 
buffer.txt file that will be deleted at the end of the script, and will append 
to zoom_codes.txt.
Errors:
invalid zoom url:
This error indicates that the pattern /j/ wasn't found in the url. This series
of characters separates the organization url from the meeting code. If you 
think you have the organization url without a meeting code, try adding /j/
when prompted for the organization url.

zoom_codes.py 
This is the driver and should be called every time you want to join a zoom 
meeting that was declared in setup.py. This script won't generate its own 
error messages. Any errors printed to the console are generated by selenium or
chromedriver.exe. 
Potential Issues:
If Zoom is not launching, first make sure that you have Zoom installed. If Zoom
is installed and still isn't launching, then watch the script as it goes. Soon 
after Chrome opens, a Zoom webpage should show up. If the url at the top
doesn't end with "?status=success" then either your organization url is wrong
or your meeting code is wrong. To fix your organization url, open settings.txt.
The line under Organization's url is the url that was put into setup.py. You 
can manually replace this line with the correct url, or you can delete the
settings.txt file entirely and run setup.py. To fix your meeting code, either
delete your entire zoom_codes.txt (NOT recommended) and run setup.py again, or 
open zoom_codes.txt, go to the meeting that failed you, and the number
underneath is the previous code. Replace that with the new code, and make sure
there are only numbers (take out dashes if there are any). If the url looks ok,
then try and change the wait times. In settings.txt, there is a Chrome load
wait and a Zoom load wait. Change the number under Chrome load wait to a larger
number. This is the number of seconds the script will wait for Chrome to load 
before trying to press "tab" then "enter". 
If Zoom launches but gets stuck at the password screen, then you either have
an incorrect password or the script isn't waiting long enough. You can change
the password in zoom_codes.txt. Scroll to the problem meeting and change the 
second number under the problem meeting to the correct password. If the script
isn't waiting long enough, open settings.txt and increase the number under 
Zoom load wait. 

Working with other browsers:
Included in this folder is chromedriver.exe. This is a webdriver for selenium
to work though. In order to work with another browser, selenium needs the 
compatable web driver for your browser. To use a different browser, find the 
corresponding web driver (for Firefox, selenium is natively supported, so there
is a plugin instead) and in zoom_codes.py, on line 40 is
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
You need to change Chrome to whatever browser you are using.
